    <h3>The fate of reading in print</h3>
    <p>Students, teachers, and parents have long deplored the rising costs of textbooks--today, a textbook in the sciences can cost hundreds of dollars, and overall, the prices of textbooks have been growing "faster than the prices of housing, cars, even health care" (NPR). Students are responding to these rising costs by purchasing used, renting, or sharing--and sometimes by not equipping themselves with the textbook, period. While most humanities disciplines eschew the use of textbooks and emphasize the kind of long-form active reading that is unsuitable for digital environments, many students elect not to purchase print materials in favor of free and often invisibly- and problematically-edited materials that are easily google-able, if reading is likely to happen at all. Faculty are shrinking their reqiuired reading in an attempt to encourage some reading; but this does not always work as students expect, for Cliff's Notes cannot substitute. However, they are seen as interchangeable by readers approaching the material from a static understanding of factual information; the plot of <i>Paradise Lost</i> is basically the same whether I read about it in Wikipedia or trudge through the 10 (or 12) books of difficult Miltonic verse, so why would I trudge through 10 (or 12) books of difficult Miltonic verse?</p>
    <p>Naomi S. Baron argues that perhaps the <em>way</em> students are, increasingly, reading is part of the reason for the decline in humanistic inquiry, because humanistic inquiry relies on deep, engaged reading and rereading, the kind of reading that is undermined in some respects by digital delivery. Baron concludes <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/How-E-Reading-Threatens/147661/">her essay in <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i> online</a> by saying, "We need to think more carefully about studentsâ€™ mounting rejection of long-form reading, now intensified by digital technologies that further complicate our struggle to engage students in serious text-based inquiry." Students resist purchasing textbooks; however, physical interaction with the page is one of the things that enables the deep reading and rereading required of the humanities.</p>
    <p>In the humanities, having access, as a class, to a good edition of a poem or a novel or a play is essential for deep reading; this must be something we can interact with, go back to, annotate, and so on. Additionally, that edition must be common to all, as every teacher knows. How do you point to a line or a page if everyone has a different edition? The digital world exacerbates this basic problem.  Print, it seems, is the best solution in the humanities. I agree with Baron--we do need to think carefully and critically about the fate of long-form reading in a digital environment. However, it is also unlikely that we will ever read <i>more</i> in print than we currently do. The question is, how can we make enable deep reading in digital platforms? This is a question that plagues everyone.</p>
    <h3>Not textbooks, but full-text</h3>
    <p>Yet, an additional problem faces small colleges and universities that lack access to the variety of proprietary electronic materials or physical special collections that enhance active learning and inquiry, the kind of pedagogy that is increasingly demanded of faculty. ECCO, NCCO, Burney Collections, and so on...</p>
