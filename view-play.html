                This page is appearing because type is play--not clear where that's set up (well, in the controller, and in app:work-title?) and how to get rid of it. There are no plays in this database, and I don't anticipate there being any need to do this test. Even if play or poem excerpts are included (or paintings, etc), they don't need to be displayed differently--no need for outline, etc.). In search results page, why are results orderd as they are if the search is narrow versus broad? Also, need to figure out the app:view function for displaying the xml with search terms highlighted.
